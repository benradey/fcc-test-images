= Running containers

When you execute a `podman run` command, you essentially spin up and create a new container from
a container image. The command you pass on the `podman run` command line sees the inside the
container as its running environment so, by default, very little can be seen of the host system.
For example, by default, the running applications sees:

* The file system provided by the container image.

* A new process table from inside the container (no processes from the host can be seen).

If you want to make a directory from the host available to the container, map network ports
from the container to the host, limit the amount of memory the container can use, or expand
the CPU shares available to the container, you can do those things from the `podman run`
command line. Here are some examples of `podman run` command lines that enable different features.

*EXAMPLE #1 (Run a quick command)*: This podman command runs the `cat /etc/os-release` command to see 
the type of operating system used as the basis for the container. After the container runs the command,
the container exits and is deleted (`--rm`).

....
# podman run --rm registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi cat /etc/os-release

REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=8.0
REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux"
REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="8.0"
...
....


*EXAMPLE #2 (View the Dockerfile in the container)*: This is another example of running a
quick command to inspect the content of a container from the host. All layered images
that Red Hat provides include the Dockerfile from which they are built in `/root/buildinfo`.
In this case you do not need to mount any volumes from the host.

You should see two images below:

image::tiger.png[]
image::switching_between_new_and_old_versions.png[]

....
# podman run --rm registry.access.redhat.com/rhel8/rsyslog  ls /root/buildinfo
Dockerfile-rhel8-rsyslog-8
....

Now you know what the Dockerfile is called, you can list its contents:

....
# podman run --rm registry.access.redhat.com/rhel8/rsyslog \
    cat /root/buildinfo/Dockerfile-rhel8-rsyslog-8
FROM sha256:eb205f07ce7d0bb63bfe560...
LABEL maintainer="Red Hat, Inc."

RUN INSTALL_PKGS="\
rsyslog \
rsyslog-gnutls \
rsyslog-gssapi \
rsyslog-mysql \
rsyslog-pgsql \
rsyslog-relp \
" && yum -y install $INSTALL_PKGS && rpm -V --nosize
    --nofiledigest --nomtime --nomode $INSTALL_PKGS && yum clean all
LABEL com.redhat.component="rsyslog-container"
LABEL name="rhel8/rsyslog"
LABEL version="8.0"
...
....
*EXAMPLE #3 (Run a shell inside the container)*: Using a container to launch a
bash shell lets you look inside the container and change the contents.
This sets the name of the container to `mybash`.
The `-i` creates an interactive session and `-t` opens a terminal session.
Without `-i`, the shell would open and then exit. Without `-t`, the shell
would stay open, but you wouldn't be able to type anything to the shell.

Once you run the command, you are presented with a shell prompt and you can
start running commands from inside the container:

....
# podman run --name=mybash -it registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi /bin/bash
[root@ed904b8f2d5c/]#  ps -ef
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 00:46 pts/0    00:00:00 /bin/bash
root        35     1  0 00:51 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -ef
[root@49830c4f9cc4/]# exit
....

Although the container is no longer running once you exit, the container still exists with the new software package still installed. Use `podman ps -a` to list the container:

....
# podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 COMMAND   CREATED        STATUS                PORTS NAMES        IS INFRA
1ca061b47bd7 .../ubi8/ubi:latest   /bin/bash 8 minutes ago  Exited 12 seconds ago       musing_brown false
...
....

You could start that container again using `podman start` with the `-ai` options. For example:

....
# podman start -ai mybash
[root@ed904b8f2d5c/]#
....

*EXAMPLE #4 (Bind mounting log files)*: One way to make log messages from inside
a container available to the host system is to bind mount the host's /dev/log
device inside the container. This example illustrates how to run an application
in a RHEL container that is named `log_test` that generates log messages (just
the logger command in this case) and directs those messages to the /dev/log
device that is mounted in the container from the host. The `--rm` option removes
the container after it runs.

....
# podman run --name="log_test" -v /dev/log:/dev/log --rm \
     registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi logger "Testing logging to the host"
# journalctl -b | grep Testing
Nov 12 20:00:10 ubi8 root[17210]: Testing logging to the host
....
