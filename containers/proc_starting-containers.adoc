= Starting containers

A container that doesn't need to run interactively can sometimes be restarted after being stopped with only the `start` option and the container ID or name. For example:

....
# podman start myrhel_httpd
myrhel_httpd
....

To start a container so you can work with it from the local shell, use the -a (attach) and -i (interactive) options. Once the bash shell starts, run the commands you want inside the container and type exit to kill the shell and stop the container.

....
# podman start -a -i agitated_hopper
[root@d65aecc325a4 /]#  exit
....
