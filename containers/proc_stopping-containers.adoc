= Stopping containers

To stop a running container that is not attached to a terminal session, use the stop option and the container ID or number. For example:

....
# podman stop 74b1da000a11
74b1da000a114015886c557deec8bed9dfb80c888097aa83f30ca4074ff55fb2
....

The `stop` option sends a SIGTERM signal to terminate a running container.
If the container doesn't stop after a grace period (10 seconds by default),
`podman` sends a SIGKILL signal.
You could also use the `podman kill` command to kill a container (SIGKILL)
or send a different signal to a container.
Here's an example of sending a
SIGHUP signal to a container (if supported by the application, a SIGHUP
causes the application to re-read its configuration files):

....
# podman kill --signal="SIGHUP" 74b1da000a11
74b1da000a114015886c557deec8bed9dfb80c888097aa83f30ca4074ff55fb2
....
