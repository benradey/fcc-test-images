= Saving and importing images

If you want to save a container image you created, you can use `podman save`
to save the image to a tarball. After that, you can store it or send it to
someone else, then reload the image later to reuse it. Here is an example
of saving an image as a tarball:

....
# podman save -o myrsyslog.tar registry.redhat.io/rhel8/rsyslog:latest
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob sha256:dd7d5adb457...
Writing manifest to image destination
Storing signatures
# ls
myrsyslog.tar
....

The `myrsyslog.tar` file should now be stored in your current directory.
Later, when you ready to reuse the tarball as a container image, you can
import it to another podman environment as follows:

....
# cat myrsyslog.tar | podman import - rhel8/myrsyslog
# podman images
....
