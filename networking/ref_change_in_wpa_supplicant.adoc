== `journalctl` can now read the `wpa_supplicant` log

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8, the [package]`wpa_supplicant` package is built with `CONFIG_DEBUG_SYSLOG` enabled. This allows reading the `wpa_supplicant` log using the `journalctl` utility instead of checking the contents of the `/var/log/wpa_supplicant.log` file.

[id="wpa-supplicant-wireless_{context}"]
== The compile-time support for wireless extensions in `wpa_supplicant` is disabled
The `wpa_supplicant` package does not support wireless extensions. When a user is trying to use `wext` as a command-line argument, or trying to use it on old adapters which only support wireless extensions, will not be able to run the `wpa_supplicant` daemon.
